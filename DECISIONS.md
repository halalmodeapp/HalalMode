# Product decisions

Record only approved deviations from Halal Mode's established core here, with a one-sentence rationale for each decision.

- **Push tokens are stored, not only hashed (2026-08-14).** `register_my_notification_device` hashed the token and discarded it, which made every notification unsendable — a push token is the address Apple and Google deliver to, and a hash cannot be reversed into one; the hash is kept alongside for deduplication, the token is readable only by the sending job, and it is deleted the moment a member turns notifications off or closes their account.
- **A member may choose their city instead of sharing device location (2026-09-29) — pending your approval.** Location was device-only, so anyone who tapped "Don't Allow" (which iOS offers once) was locked out of onboarding permanently, and on the web — where the browser cannot name a place — nobody could finish at all; a city chosen from a fixed list arrives with that city's centre coordinates as a pair, which keeps the server's real rule that a place name and its coordinates always change together.
